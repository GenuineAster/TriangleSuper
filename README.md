# TriangleSuper #

TriangleSuper was supposed to be my Ludum Dare 26 entry. However, due to issues, I didn't have time to submit it.
TriangleSuper is a fast-paced game, in which you play as a hexagon, and try to avoid triangle-delta-things that head towards you.
Some of the more noticeable features in this game are the particle effects it has, and the music. The whole thing was produced by me, except for when a commit was pushed by someone else, obviously.
